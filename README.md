## At a Glance

**ZipMonster** is a library that simplifies work with zip codes and addresses in the United States. This solution is a reliable replacement for paid APIs that you can find on the Internet.

## Important

I dedicate a considerable amount of my free time to developing and maintaining my open source software. To help ensure this package is kept updated, new features are added and bugfixes are implemented quickly, please donate a couple of dollars (or a little more if you can stretch) as this will help me to afford to dedicate time to its maintenance. Please consider donating if you're using this software in an app that makes you money, if you're being paid to make the app, if you're asking for new features or priority bug fixes. I accept donations only in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Thank you for your support!

## How to Get Started

Type in Terminal:

```
npm install --save @simplisticated/zip-monster
```

or, if you prefer **yarn** over **npm**, type:

```
yarn add @simplisticated/zip-monster
```

Then add import instruction to your code:

```typescript
import ZipMonster from '@simplisticated/zip-monster'
```

or

```typescript
import Z from '@simplisticated/zip-monster'
```

## Requirements

It's strongly recommended to add `NODE_OPTIONS` flag to your `.env` file:

```
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=<AVAILABLE RAM SIZE IN MB>
```

For example, if you have 2GB RAM:

```
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=2048
```

## Usage

Everything starts from `Z` object.

The main method is `Z.find`. It's a super flexible way to search the information.

----

### Search by zip code

If you know exactly what zip code you're looking for, simply write:

```typescript
Z.find({
    zip: "91360"
})
```

In response, you will receive an array of `ZipInformation` objects that correspond to your search request. Each object includes the following data:

```typescript
{
    stateCode: "CA",
    city: "Thousand Oaks",
    county: "Ventura",
    zip: "91360",
    zipType: "Non-Unique",
    location: {
        latitude: 34.2090940366232,
        longitude: -118.875059125606
    }
}
```

To get city name, you can write:

```typescript
const zipCodes = Z.find({
    zip: "91360"
});
const city = zipCodes[0].city // Thousand Oaks
```

----

### Search by city

You can also search by city:

```typescript
Z.find({
    city: "Thousand Oaks"
})
```

The expression above will return array of `ZipInformation` objects related to Thousand Oaks.

Also, you can search by part of city name:

```typescript
Z.find({
    city: {
        value: "THOUSAND",
        caseSensitive: false,
        wholeMatch: false
    }
})
```

which returns zip code information for all cities that contain `THOUSAND` in the name.

----

### Search by county

```typescript
Z.find({
    county: "Vermont"
})
```

or

```typescript
Z.find({
    county: {
        value: "vermont",
        caseSensitive: false,
        wholeMatch: true
    }
})
```

----

### Search by state

```typescript
Z.find({
    stateCode: "CA"
})
```

----

### Search by location

Let's find cities that are further to north than Palo Alto. That's a very simple task:

```typescript
const PaloAlto = Z.find({
    city: "Palo Alto",
    stateCode: "CA",
    withLocationOnly: true
})[0];
const placesFurtherToNorth = Z.find({
    location: {
        latitude: {
            value: PaloAlto.location!.latitude,
            direction: "to-north"
        }
    }
});
placesFurtherToNorth.length // 21404 places are further to north than Palo Alto
```

----

### Combine search parameters

You can also combine search parameters with each other:

```typescript
const result = Z.find({
    city: {
        value: "THOUSAND",
        caseSensitive: false,
        wholeMatch: false
    },
    county: {
        value: "Vent",
        caseSensitive: false,
        wholeMatch: false
    },
    stateCode: "CA"
})
const city = result[0].city // Thousand Oaks
```

----

### What about more complicated logic?

Let's find all zip codes between Austin and Oklahoma City:

```typescript
// Take the first zip code in Austin
const Austin = Z.find({
    city: "Austin",
    stateCode: "TX",
    withLocationOnly: true
})[0];

// Find places to north and east from Austin
const placesToNorthFromAustin = Z.find({
    location: {
        latitude: {
            value: Austin.location!.latitude,
            direction: "to-north"
        },
        longitude: {
            value: Austin.location!.longitude,
            direction: "to-east"
        }
    }
});

// Take the first zip code in Oklahoma City
const OklahomaCity = Z.find({
    city: "Oklahoma City",
    stateCode: "OK",
    withLocationOnly: true
})[0];

// Find places to south and west from Oklahoma City, but stop at Austin
const placesBetweenAustinAndOklahomaCity = Z.find({
    location: {
        latitude: {
            value: OklahomaCity.location!.latitude,
            direction: "to-south"
        },
        longitude: {
            value: OklahomaCity.location!.longitude,
            direction: "to-west"
        }
    },
    source: placesToNorthFromAustin
});

placesBetweenAustinAndOklahomaCity.length // 79 zip codes found
```

----

### Other cases

If you don't use any filter with the method, it will return information about **all existing zip codes**:

```typescript
const zipCodes = Z.find();
zipCodes.length // more than 40k zip codes in the array
```
